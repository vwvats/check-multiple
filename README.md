# Hold Shift to Check Multiple

One of the common features of email clients is the ability to check multiple items if the shift key is held down while checking two items that have multiple items in between. All items between the first and last get checked. 

This is a JavaSctipt implementation of the same feature, built as a challenge from one of Wes Bos' course JavaScript30!
